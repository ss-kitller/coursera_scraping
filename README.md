					 Coursera Scaraping:

Note: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for commercial purposes or to violate any website's terms of service

In this project I sccraped Coursera web page to gather all the information (name of the course, name of the certifier, rating, skills you will gain, duration of the course, level of the course, type of the certification) about the certifications available. 

I then structured all the data in a CSV file and uploaded it next to the code.

Later, we can apply algorithms to the tables to sort the data.

Feel free to copy my code or make any modification you want :)
