# Coursera Scaraping:

In order to get a better view on certificates, I took Coursera as an example and made a little study :)

In this project I sccraped Coursera web page to gather all the information (name of the course, name of the certifier, rating, skills you will gain, duration of the course, level of the course, type of the certification) about the certifications available. 

I then structured all the data in a CSV file and uploaded it next to the code.

Later, we can apply algorithms to the tables to sort the data the way we want.


Feel free to copy my code or make any modification you want :) .
